# Origins
First github project and game!

Current Status: Unfinished :(

Developing a game and learning how to do it is something I always wanted to do, and Origins is just that! It is a class monster fighting game 
      where the user will be pitted against different monsters each with their own unique abilities as well as their own unique interactions.
      
5 different types of monsters, each with their personal "shiny counter" that will change them into a cooler looking version of the type!

You have 3 options, Attack Defend and Heal.

This game is made using Java Swing.
